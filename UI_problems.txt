Template

Page: problem

1. Index page: "Create Poll" and "Join Poll" buttons squished together when width < ~364 px

2. Poll creation page: "Sort By" and "Refine" columns in the "Filter and Sort" menu get pushed down when the "Categories" column has multi-line labels

3. A "Cancel" button needs to be added to the search filter menu

4. "Filter and Sort" menu is messed up on smartphone displays.
